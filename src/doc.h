/// The sequencer only gets ticked (advancing document playback and triggering notes)
/// on a fraction of these timer events, determined by the "sequencer rate" value
/// (not saved in document, but computed from tempo).
///
/// (Note that the S-SMP timer's base frequency varies between consoles
/// because it uses a cheap ceramic resonator as a frequency source.
/// It is nominally 8000 Hz, but is higher in practice, on average 8010 Hz or more.)
///
/// The user specifies a `target_tempo` (in BPM), which gets converted into an
/// "sequencer rate" upon in-tracker playback or SPC export.
/// The song playback rate (in BPM) is determined by the "sequencer rate",
/// as well as `spc_timer_period` and `ticks_per_beat` (specified by the user).
///
/// What is the conversion formula to calculate the best "sequencer rate"
/// for a target tempo?
/// Let t = `target_tempo`, d = `spc_timer_period`, r = "sequencer rate", p = `ticks_per_beat`.
/// To compute the appropriate "sequencer rate" for a given tempo,
/// solve for r in terms of t.
///
///     t = (8010 timers / d s) * (r ticks / 256 timers) * (1 beat / p ticks) * (60 s / min)
///     t = (8010*60/256)r/dp beat/min
///     (dp*256/60/8010)t = r
///
/// The default values of d=16 and p=48 (taken from AMK) results in r â‰ˆ 0.4091*t. As a
/// result, the only achievable tempos are multiples of around 2.5 BPM.
///
/// Increasing `ticks_per_beat` makes note timing and tempo more fine-grained, but
/// makes exported .spcs more likely to lag.

/// .spcs less likely to lag) and makes tempo more fine-grained, but increases note
